# Remote Keyboard PC-Client

Android supports almost all the language and it is very easy to write there. However writing these languages in PC is really hard for a newcomer in that language. So to use Android's power to use these languages in PC this App is developed.

This app was created when I was a newbie in Java, Android and OOP. It was a beginner intro project to socket too. So code quality and UI is not so good ^^;. Also I did not know much about version control back then so the commit history is empty.

Usage: Connect your Android to this app using the Android client app and you are good to go.
